# Tutorials overview

The ensuing sections contain interactive Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use various functionalities available in **SpectraNorm**. Each tutorial focuses on a specific aspect of the package, providing step-by-step instructions and example code. The tutorials are designed to help users get started with spectral normative modeling and to illustrate how to apply the methods to exemplary datasets.

The tutorials start by explaining most basic functionalities of the package, such as how to fit a univariate normative model to data and how to visualize the results. Subsequent tutorials will cover more advanced topics, such as how to construct graph spectral eigenbases, and how to apply spectral normative modeling to charachterize data defined on graphs. The tutorials also include neuroimaging-specific examples, such as how to apply spectral normative modeling to cortical thickness data extracted from a new imaging study.

These tutorials are intended to be accessible to users with varying levels of experience with programming and normative modeling.

## Overview of available tutorials:

- [A simple univariate normative model](univariate_model.ipynb): This tutorial demonstrates how to fit a simple univariate normative model to data, and how to visualize the results using the plotting utilities available in the package.

- [Constructing graph spectral eigenbases](eigenmode_bases.ipynb): This tutorial demonstrates how to construct graph spectral eigenbases using the utilities available in the package, and how to use these bases to represent high-dimensional data defined on graphs.
