# Statistical Utilities

The statistical utilities module provides functions for performing various statistical analyses and computations that are commonly used in the context of spectral normative modeling. Notably, this includes functions complementary to the metrics utilities, such as functions for computing log-likelihoods and centile scores, which are essential for evaluating the fit of normative models and for interpreting the results of empirical data analyses.
