# Metrics Utilities

The metrics utilities module provides functions for evaluating the performance of normative models. This includes functions for computing various error metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) scores, among others. These metrics are essential for assessing the fit of the model to the data and for comparing different models.
