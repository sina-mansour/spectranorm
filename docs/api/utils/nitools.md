# Neuroimaging Tools

The neuroimaging tools module provides functions for working with neuroimaging data, including handling cortical surface data (e.g., from FreeSurfer), performing spatial transformations, and computing graph-based representations of brain data. These tools enable seamless integration of spectral normative modeling with neuroimaging datasets, i.e., users can apply spectral normative models to data extracted from common neuroimaging preprocessing pipelines.
